# Weather API Web App

### Installation and Testing

- This project is easily installed once cloned using `npm install` to configure all the various packages

- I would love to host this web app, but the `OpenWeatherMap` API has very strict use limits for free accounts

- To test and run the project, use `npm run dev` (the local port is set by default to `3000`)

### Function

- The `Weather App` calls upon realtime weather and time data from an API, and displays it neatly 

- There are 5 default locations, but the search querier will automatically populate a city's weather data

### Notes

- Tailwind `4.0` has some difficulties on `Safari` (at least in my experience) so I'd advise running in `Chrome`

- All the large UI and animations are drawn by me

- The app is built using Javascript as instructed, with `Tailwind` CSS and `Vite` build tools

- The project is small and uses no navigation, all files and components should be easily reachable through `/src`
